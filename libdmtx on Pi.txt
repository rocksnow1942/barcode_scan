I suppose there's no pre-built library for Raspberry Pi. So you can build it by yourself. Here is the source code:

https://github.com/dmtx/libdmtx

Take 3 steps to build and install the libdmtx library:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
After installing the libdmtx library, your Python code should work.
